#                  RECUSRION
    >recursion is the process where a function call itself
	>to achieve a certain functionality.You need to set a base line
	>for the recursive function less it becomes an endless recall
	>which then leads to seg fault
	>these tasks have all been done using recursion and no loop
	>has been used
